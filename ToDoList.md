### To Do List

#### 01-6-2022

 - work out how to deal with symmetry
 - add more elements to list 19F, Silicon, etc :: completed
 - add save option :: completed
 - add new option :: completed

#### 12-6-2022

 - take xy positions from smiles input molecules as starting positions for overlaying nodes
 - use info from rdkit about the molecule to map place nodes over guess molecule
    - carbonyl atoms
    - methyl carbons
    - aromatic carbons
    - hose codes for ppm
    - could calculate expected cosy
    - could calculate expected hsqc
    - could calculate expected hmbc patterns

#### 12-8-2022

 - error message when dragging cursor over molecule plot, but not on a node
  - fixed 12-8-2022

#### 12-8-2022

 - zoom in molecule plot crashes program :: Fixed

#### 24-9-2022

 - add window so that smiles image can be rotated for a better viewing angle in 2D representation
 - start off program from taking info from hsqc and hmbc rather than directlyt from 1D carbon and proton
 - save final assignments in human readable report
 - view and edit original excel sheets
 - add logging so that we can see what was done in the program
 - add j-coupling values in pop-ups
 - use pylint to clean up code
 - work on documentation

#### 25-9-2022

  - add NOESY information

#### 20-10-2022

  - create c13 plot that looks like a dept with color coded for quarternary carbons
